- Some reflections:
  - My lack of formal CS knowledge is a hindrance, especially Algorithms and Data Structures.
    - Many tasks involved Depth/Breadth-first search
  - These type of core CS problems seem more suited for imperative and mutable languages. Many problems involved explicit arrays and working with indices.
  - Lots of the days I skipped involved parsing I deemed too annoying. I personally don't really understand why they make the input text so complicated; using JSON etc. would skip straight to the problem solving.
